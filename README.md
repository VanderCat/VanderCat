I’m [@VanderCat](https://github.com/VanderCat/) AKA Влад Кот (Vlad Kot) 
 
A lot of my project isn't about to be finished ever.

Some facts:
- I know several languages: Python, Lua, C#, C, JS and a bit more but neither of them i know perfectly */shrug face/*
- I'm currently working on some projects time to time, but neither of them is available on github yet. sorry bout that
- Love ux/ui lol
- I also make music, but most of it in vk. Some availiable on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/vandercat-chanel) 

You can contact me in [telegram](https://t.me/VanderCat) or in [vk](http://vk.me/Vander_Cat)
